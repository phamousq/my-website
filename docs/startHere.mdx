# Hi, I'm Quinton! Nice to meet you!

![pic of me](../static/img/headshot/photo.jpg)

I'm a Senior at the University of Texas at Austin completing a degree in Biochemistry and the Elements of Computing (Computer Science) Certificate. I'm creating this website in hopes to share some of the lessons I've learned throughout my time in school, hopefully you will find something useful! If anything is unclear or if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out! I'd love to chat about anything!

Throughout my time in college, I have been an Orientation Advisor, First-Year Student Mentor (FIG Mentor), and (probably most importantly) have lived through being a CNS Student at UT. The advice and information I am providing on this webiste is going to be geared towards those in the Natural Sciences and pre-med track, but I'll do my best to keep things as generral as possible so you can follow along, regardless of your major.

:::caution

This website is still being built and nowhere near ready for human eyes, so if you've found your way here it probably means i got excited and wanted to show you or you're SUPER bored.
Come back in a few weeks and it should be populated!
