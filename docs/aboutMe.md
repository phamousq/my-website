  Hey! My name is Quinton and I'm a rising Senior at the University of Texas at
  Austin studying Biochemistry and some Computer Science. I also took an
  inexuberent amount of time to make this website so I hppe you enjoy it! This
  website is aimed at capturing my experiences through life thus far and
  hopefully pass on any knowledge that I think was useful to me. The creation of
  this blog is happening amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

  not really sure of the theme and things of this site but I figure that I have
  a lot of value to put out into the world and hopefully you can find something
  useful out of it!
