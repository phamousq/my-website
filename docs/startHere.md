####

Hey! My name is Quinton and I'm a rising Senior at the University of Texas at
Austin studying Biochemistry and some Computer Science. I also took an
inexuberent amount of time to make this website so I hppe you enjoy it! This
website is aimed at capturing my experiences through life thus far and
hopefully pass on any knowledge that I think was useful to me. The creation of
this blog is happening amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

:::caution

This website is still being built and nowhere near ready for human eyes, so if you've found your way here it probably means i got excited and wanted to show you or you're SUPER bored.
Come back in a few weeks and it should be populated!
