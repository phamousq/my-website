# Building this Website

Currently, I am thinking about how I would like to bring the thoughts that I am having in my heads into the world. I am currently reading "How to Take Smart Notes" which is helping me with this. As much as this book is helping with getting the content down on 'paper', it is also formatted a lot like a self help book. 

## tools used for this website
- built on top of [Docusaurus version 2.0.0-alpha.73](https://docusaurus.io/docs/)
	- thinking about moving this to Gatsby, but I think this would just take more time and would be overkill for what I am using this site for.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the code and initial writing of the text
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write out the content
	- Since this site is meant to host finalized or 'permanent notes', I don't think I should be editing the notes directly from here to obsidian. I think the goal here is to have my own personal (and private) knowledge management collection, and then copy and paste snippets and get ideas from there to put onto the website. This process should happen independently of my daily writing and I should be looking to update this website with more information at least once a week. 
	- [ ] does not support using H1 as the title name for the document - file names will contain spaces which is not ideal
	- [ ] can't exclude certain files from the finder and seach which crowds the view and such.
	- [ ] drag and drop for photos does not work. must use the `![]()` format instead of `![]`
